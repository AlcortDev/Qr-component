### What I learned

it's been a long time since i don't code anything to frontend, so... i'm a little bit rusty. I wanted to come back and actualy start coding some stuff and trying new technologies i wasn't familiar with.

I did strugle a bit trying to set it up for the first time, but i found my way at the end.

i loved learning how to use this custom properties, i think is pretty easy to understand and once you get used to them, they become practicaly something you are going to use 100% of the time

```css
@theme{
    --breakpoint-mobile: 375px;
    --breakpoint-pc:1024px;
    
    --color-White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --color-Slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --color-Slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
    --color-Slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

}
